# Cloudflare Error Pages

[Live Demo](https://mrdemonwolf.github.io/cf-pages/)

Cloudflare-Error is a set of clean and professional HTML templates designed for use as error pages in Cloudflare's [custom page](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200172706-Configuring-Custom-Pages-Error-and-Challenge-) section. This repository uses the latest version of Tailwind CSS served by Cloudflare's cdnjs.

## Installation

Modify each template to your liking and use a service such as [Netflify Drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop) to host your HTML templates temporarily. Then, head over to your custom page settings in your organisation's Cloudflare account and add each page as required using the full URL.
